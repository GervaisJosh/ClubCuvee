# Image Upload Troubleshooting Guide

## What We've Fixed

1. **Removed test button** - Focus on actual form submission
2. **Added comprehensive logging** throughout the upload process
3. **Verified the upload code exists** in the form submission flow

## Console Output to Check

When you fill out the form and click "Create Wine Club", the console should show:

### Expected Flow:
```
=== PRE-UPLOAD AUTH CHECK ===
Current auth context: { userId: "...", isAuthenticated: true, ... }

=== BUSINESS CREATED ===
Business ID: abc-123-def-456

=== UPLOAD STATE CHECK ===
Logo upload state: { hasLogoFile: true, logoFileName: "logo.png", ... }
Tier images state: [{ tierName: "Gold", hasImageFile: true, ... }]

=== PROCEEDING WITH LOGO UPLOAD ===
=== LOGO UPLOAD START ===
[Either SUCCESS or FAILED with details]

=== CHECKING TIER IMAGES FOR UPLOAD ===
Total tiers to check: 3
[Details for each tier]

=== UPLOAD PROCESS COMPLETE ===
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "hasLogoFile: false" in Upload State Check
**Problem**: The File object isn't being stored in state
**Solution**: Check `handleLogoUpload` function - ensure `setLogoFile(file)` is called

### Issue 2: No "PROCEEDING WITH LOGO UPLOAD" message
**Problem**: The `if (logoFile && businessId)` condition is false
**Solution**: Check both values are truthy in the logs

### Issue 3: Upload fails with auth error
**Problem**: User isn't authenticated during upload
**Solution**: The business creation API might be creating a new auth session

### Issue 4: Upload fails with policy error
**Problem**: Storage RLS policies are blocking the upload
**Solution**: Check the policies allow authenticated users to upload

## Quick Debug Checklist

1. **Are File objects being stored?**
   - Check "UPLOAD STATE CHECK" logs
   - Should show `hasLogoFile: true` if a logo was selected

2. **Is the upload code being reached?**
   - Look for "PROCEEDING WITH LOGO UPLOAD" message
   - If missing, the condition to upload isn't met

3. **What's the exact error?**
   - Check "LOGO UPLOAD FAILED" section
   - Look at error details for specific issue

4. **Is auth working?**
   - Check "PRE-UPLOAD AUTH CHECK"
   - Should show `isAuthenticated: true`

## Most Likely Issues

Based on the code review, the most likely issues are:

1. **File State Not Set**: The `logoFile` state might be null even after selecting a file
2. **Auth Context Lost**: The user might not be authenticated during the upload attempt
3. **API Creates Business Without Auth**: The `/api/create-business` endpoint might create the business with a service key, losing user context

## Next Steps

1. Run the form and check console output
2. Share the specific error messages from the "UPLOAD FAILED" sections
3. Check if `hasLogoFile: true` appears in the state check

The detailed logging will pinpoint exactly where the process is failing.
