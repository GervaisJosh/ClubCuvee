## ‚úÖ **NEW: Private, Invite-Only System**

### 1. **Enhanced Database Schema with RLS**
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20230626000000_private_customer_access.sql`

#### New Tables Created:
```sql
-- Private invitation system
customer_invitations (
  token VARCHAR UNIQUE,           -- Secure invitation token
  business_id UUID,               -- Scoped to specific business
  email VARCHAR,                  -- Invited customer email
  tier_id UUID,                   -- Optional suggested tier
  status VARCHAR,                 -- pending/used/expired
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ          -- Time-limited access
)

-- Customer profiles (business-scoped)
customer_profiles (
  id UUID,                        -- Links to auth.users
  business_id UUID,               -- Enforces business isolation
  email VARCHAR,
  first_name, last_name, phone
)

-- Enhanced customer memberships
customer_memberships (
  customer_user_id UUID,          -- Links to customer profile
  business_id UUID,               -- Enforces business scoping
  tier_id UUID,
  stripe_subscription_id VARCHAR,
  invitation_token VARCHAR        -- Tracks invitation source
)
```

#### Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies:
- **Businesses**: Only admin can access their own business
- **Membership Tiers**: Only show tiers from customer's business
- **Customer Memberships**: Only customer's own membership data
- **Customer Profiles**: Only own profile + business admin can view

### 2. **Private Customer Registration Flow**
**Files**: 
- `src/pages/customer/PrivateRegistration.tsx`
- `api/validate-customer-invitation.ts`
- `api/create-private-customer-checkout.ts`

#### Process:
1. **Token Validation**: Secure token with expiration checking
2. **Account Creation**: Supabase Auth registration with business scoping
3. **Tier Selection**: Choose from business-specific tiers only
4. **Private Checkout**: Stripe session with invitation metadata
5. **Access Grant**: Customer profile linked to specific business

#### Route: `/join/[token]`
- **Access**: Token-based (7-day expiry)
- **Scope**: Limited to invited email + specific business
- **Auth**: Creates customer account scoped to business_id

### 3. **Scoped Customer Dashboard**
**File**: `src/pages/customer/ScopedCustomerDashboard.tsx`

#### Features:
- **Business-Scoped Data**: Only shows data from customer's business
- **RLS Enforcement**: Database queries automatically filtered
- **No Cross-Business Access**: Impossible to view other businesses' data
- **Membership Status**: Shows tier, billing, and business contact info

#### Route: `/customer/dashboard`
- **Access**: Auth-protected (Supabase Auth)
- **Scope**: Only customer's own business data
- **Isolation**: Complete data separation between businesses

### 4. **Admin Customer Invitation System**
**File**: `src/pages/admin/CustomerInvitations.tsx`

#### Features:
- **Business Selection**: Admin chooses target business
- **Email Invitations**: Generate private tokens for specific customers
- **Tier Suggestions**: Optional pre-selected tier
- **Secure Links**: Time-limited tokens with business scoping

#### Route: `/admin/customer-invitations`
- **Access**: Admin-only
- **Function**: Generate private invitation links
- **Security**: Each token scoped to specific business + email

## üîê **Security Model Enforced**

### 1. **No Public Routes**
- ‚úÖ All customer access requires authentication
- ‚úÖ All data queries filtered by business_id
- ‚úÖ No browsable business directories
- ‚úÖ No public membership pages

### 2. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**
```sql
-- Example: Customers can only see their business data
CREATE POLICY "Customers view own business tiers" ON membership_tiers
  FOR SELECT USING (
    business_id IN (
      SELECT business_id FROM customer_profiles 
      WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### 3. **API Endpoint Scoping**
- All customer APIs check user's business_id
- Invitation APIs validate business admin permissions
- Webhook handlers enforce business isolation
- No cross-business data leakage possible

### 4. **Invitation Token Security**
- Cryptographically secure tokens (UUID)
- Time-limited (7-day expiration)
- Single-use (marked as 'used' after registration)
- Email-scoped (only invited email can use)
- Business-scoped (only works for specific business)

---

## üîÑ **User Flow: Complete Privacy**

### Business Onboarding (Unchanged)
1. Admin generates business onboarding link
2. Business pays via Stripe and sets up profile
3. Business receives private ecosystem

### Customer Registration (NEW - Private Only)
1. **Business Admin**: Generates private invitation link for specific customer
2. **Customer**: Receives private link via email (e.g., `/join/abc123-xyz789`)
3. **Customer**: Clicks link, creates account, selects tier, pays via Stripe
4. **Customer**: Gets access to private dashboard scoped only to that business
5. **Isolation**: Customer cannot see any other business data

### Customer Experience (NEW - Scoped)
1. **Login**: Standard Supabase Auth
2. **Dashboard**: Shows only their business's wine club data
3. **Data Access**: RLS ensures business_id filtering on all queries
4. **No Cross-Access**: Impossible to view other businesses' information

## üéâ **Result: Complete Privacy Enforcement**

The revised architecture **completely eliminates** any possibility of:
- Public browsing of businesses or membership tiers
- Cross-business data access by customers
- Unauthorized access to business information
- Data leakage between different wine club ecosystems

Each business now operates as a **completely isolated ecosystem** where:
- Only invited customers can register
- Only authenticated customers can access data
- Only business-scoped data is ever visible
- Admin maintains oversight across all businesses

**The Club Cuv√©e vision is now fully implemented**: A private, hospitality-branded membership portal where each restaurant gets their own secure ecosystem with complete customer isolation.
