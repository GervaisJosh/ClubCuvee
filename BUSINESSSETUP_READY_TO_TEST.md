# BusinessSetup.tsx - Ready to Test

## Changes Made

### 1. **Inlined Supabase Client**
Removed external import and created Supabase client inline:
```typescript
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
  auth: {
    autoRefreshToken: true,
    persistSession: true,
    detectSessionInUrl: true
  }
});
```

### 2. **Removed Unused Imports**
- Removed unused Lucide icons: MapPin, DollarSign, Check, Zap, Shield
- Kept only the icons actually used in the component

### 3. **Removed Debug Mode**
- Removed the `debugMode` state variable
- Kept all console logging active for testing

### 4. **Fixed TypeScript Issues**
- Build now completes successfully with no errors
- Component is 31.25 kB (gzipped: 7.93 kB)

## Key Debugging Features Active

### 1. **Pre-Upload Auth Check**
Shows current user authentication status before attempting uploads

### 2. **Business Ownership Verification**
Critical check that compares:
- Business owner_id from database
- Current authenticated user ID
- Will show "OWNERSHIP MISMATCH" if they don't match

### 3. **Upload State Check**
Shows whether files are stored in state:
- Logo file details
- Tier image details

### 4. **Detailed Upload Logging**
- Shows exactly where uploads fail
- Provides specific error messages
- Identifies policy violations

## Testing Instructions

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
2. **Fill out the form** with test data
3. **Select a logo and tier images**
4. **Submit the form**
5. **Watch console for**:
   - `=== BUSINESS CREATED ===`
   - `=== VERIFYING BUSINESS OWNERSHIP ===`
   - Look for `ownershipMatch: false` (indicates the problem)
   - `=== LOGO UPLOAD FAILED ===` with specific error

## Expected Issue

You'll likely see:
```
OWNERSHIP MISMATCH: Current user does not own the business!
This will cause RLS policy violations during upload.
```

This confirms the API is creating businesses without setting the correct owner_id.

## RLS Policies Applied

The storage bucket now has strict RLS policies that check business ownership:
- Users can only upload to folders for businesses they own
- The folder name (business ID) must match a business where owner_id = current user ID

## Ready to Test

The component is now clean, uses inline imports, and has comprehensive logging to identify the exact upload failure point.
