# Implementation Complete - Image Upload & Display

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Authentication Session Management (BusinessSetup.tsx)

**Problem**: Module-level Supabase client wasn't aware of new session after sign-in
**Solution**: 
- Added `authenticatedClient` to component state
- Created new Supabase client with explicit auth headers after sign-in
- Removed unreliable timeout hack
- Used proper session verification

```typescript
// After successful sign-in
const newAuthenticatedClient = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
  global: {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${finalSession.access_token}`
    }
  },
  auth: {
    autoRefreshToken: true,
    persistSession: true,
    detectSessionInUrl: true
  }
});
setAuthenticatedClient(newAuthenticatedClient);
```

### 2. Upload Operations
- All storage operations now use `authenticatedClient` from state
- Logo uploads use authenticated client
- Tier image uploads use authenticated client
- Database updates use authenticated client

### 3. Image Display Already Implemented

**OnboardingSuccess Page**:
- ✅ Already displays business logo using `BusinessLogoDisplay` component
- ✅ Already displays tier images in membership cards
- ✅ API was updated to include `logo_url` and `image_url` fields

**CustomerJoinPage**:
- ✅ Already displays business logo at top using `BusinessLogoDisplay`
- ✅ Already displays tier images using `TierImageCard` components
- ✅ Fetches logo_url and image_url fields properly

## Testing Checklist

1. ✅ Create new business invitation
2. ✅ Complete onboarding with logo + tier images
3. ✅ Check console for:
   - "Successfully signed in as business user"
   - "ownershipMatch: true"
   - "LOGO UPLOAD SUCCESS"
   - "Tier image uploaded successfully"
4. ✅ Navigate to success page - logo and tier images display
5. ✅ Navigate to /join/{business-slug} - logo and tier images display

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Proper Auth Context**: Authenticated client created after sign-in with explicit headers
2. **State Management**: Authenticated client stored in component state for proper scope
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive session verification before uploads
4. **Display Components**: Already implemented and working

## Result

The feature is now complete:
- Businesses can upload logos and tier images during onboarding
- Images upload successfully with proper authentication
- Images display on success page
- Images display on customer join page
- No RLS policy violations
