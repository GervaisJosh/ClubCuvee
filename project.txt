- TailwindCSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Recharts for data visualization
- React Dropzone for file uploads

### Backend
- Supabase as the backend service
- Node.js server components
- TypeScript for type safety

### Development Tools
- ESLint for code linting
- TypeScript for static typing
- PostCSS for CSS processing
- Vercel for deployment

## Project Architecture

The project follows a modern React-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:
