# Vercel Node.js 22 Configuration - Correct Fix ✅

## The Real Issue
The error `Function Runtimes must have a valid version` wasn't because Node.js 22 isn't supported - it's because Vercel doesn't use `runtime` in the functions configuration anymore. Vercel determines the Node.js version from your `package.json` engines field.

## Understanding Vercel's Email
- Vercel IS supporting Node.js 22
- They're deprecating Node.js 18 on September 1st, 2025
- You need to UPGRADE to Node.js 22, not downgrade

## Correct Solution Applied

### 1. vercel.json - Removed Runtime Specification
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run vercel-build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "functions": {
    "api/*.js": {
      "maxDuration": 10
    }
  }
}
```
**Key change**: Removed `"runtime": "nodejs22.x"` - this syntax is invalid/deprecated

### 2. package.json - Uses Node.js 22
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "22.x"
  }
}
```
**This is where Vercel reads the Node.js version from!**

### 3. .nvmrc - Keeps Node.js 22
```
22.11.0
```

## How Vercel Determines Node.js Version

1. **Primary**: Reads from `package.json` engines field
2. **Fallback**: Uses `.nvmrc` if no engines specified
3. **Default**: Falls back to their default if neither exists

The `runtime` field in functions configuration is NOT used for Node.js version selection.

## Why This Works

- ✅ Uses Node.js 22 as Vercel requested in their email
- ✅ Removes invalid runtime syntax that caused the error
- ✅ Follows Vercel's current best practices
- ✅ Future-proof for the Node.js 18 deprecation

## Deployment Commands
```bash
# Commit the correct configuration
git add vercel.json package.json .nvmrc
git commit -m "fix: configure Node.js 22 via package.json engines field

- Remove invalid runtime specification from functions
- Use package.json engines field for Node.js version
- Keep Node.js 22 as requested by Vercel

Vercel reads Node.js version from package.json, not functions.runtime"

# Push to deploy
git push origin main
```

## Verification
After deployment, check:
1. Build logs should show Node.js 22.x being used
2. No runtime errors
3. Functions work correctly

## Key Takeaway
**Vercel's Node.js version is set by `package.json` engines, NOT by functions runtime!**

The original error was about invalid syntax, not unsupported Node.js version. This fix:
- Uses Node.js 22 as intended
- Removes the deprecated/invalid runtime syntax
- Aligns with Vercel's deprecation timeline for Node.js 18
