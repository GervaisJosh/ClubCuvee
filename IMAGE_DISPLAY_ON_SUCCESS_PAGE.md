# Image Display on Success Page - Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

### API Update (`/api/get-business-by-token.ts`)

Added image fields to the database queries:

1. **Business Logo**:
   - Added `logo_url` to the businesses select query
   - Updated response to include `logo_url: business.logo_url || null`

2. **Tier Images**:
   - Added `image_url` to the membership_tiers select query
   - Added `benefits` to the query as well
   - Updated response mapping to include:
     - `image_url: tier.image_url || null`
     - `benefits: tier.benefits || []`

### Frontend Display

The OnboardingSuccess page **already had** the display logic:

1. **Business Logo** (lines 181-186):
   ```tsx
   <BusinessLogoDisplay
     logoUrl={businessData.business.logo_url}
     businessName={businessData.business.name}
     size="large"
     className="mx-auto mb-6"
   />
   ```

2. **Tier Images** (lines 210-218):
   ```tsx
   {tier.image_url && (
     <div className="h-32 w-full overflow-hidden">
       <img 
         src={tier.image_url} 
         alt={tier.name}
         className="w-full h-full object-cover"
       />
     </div>
   )}
   ```

### Customer Join Page

The CustomerJoinPage already fetches all fields with `select('*')` and has the necessary components to display images.

## Result

✅ Business logos now display on the success page
✅ Tier images now display in the membership tier cards
✅ No authentication logic was modified
✅ API compiled successfully
✅ All existing functionality preserved

The images will automatically display when businesses have uploaded them during the setup process.
