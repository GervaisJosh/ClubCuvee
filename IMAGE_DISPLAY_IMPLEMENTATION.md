# Image Display Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. **CustomerJoinPage** (`/join/{business-slug}`)
✅ **Already Implemented**
- Business logo displays using `BusinessLogoDisplay` component
- Tier images display using `TierImageCard` component
- Both components were already imported and configured

### 2. **CustomerWelcome** (after payment)
✅ **Already Implemented**
- Business logo displays at the top using `BusinessLogoDisplay`
- Tier image shows as a subtle background in the membership card
- Creates an elegant, layered effect with opacity

### 3. **OnboardingSuccess** (business success page)
✅ **Just Updated**
- Added `BusinessLogoDisplay` import
- Added business logo to the header section
- Updated membership tier cards to show tier images
- Images display at the top of each tier card
- Fallback to Users icon when no image is uploaded

## How Images Are Displayed

### Business Logos
Using the `BusinessLogoDisplay` component:
```typescript
<BusinessLogoDisplay
  logoUrl={business.logo_url}
  businessName={business.name}
  size="large"
  className="mx-auto mb-6"
/>
```

### Tier Images
- **CustomerJoinPage**: Full `TierImageCard` component with selection state
- **CustomerWelcome**: Background image with opacity overlay
- **OnboardingSuccess**: Card header image with cover fit

## Styling Approach

1. **Consistent Image Handling**
   - `object-cover` for tier images (consistent sizing)
   - `object-contain` for logos (preserve aspect ratio)
   - Overflow hidden on containers for clean edges

2. **Dark Mode Support**
   - Images work well in both light and dark modes
   - Subtle borders and shadows adjust automatically

3. **Loading States**
   - Graceful fallbacks when no image is uploaded
   - Icons or initials display instead

## Result

All customer-facing pages now display the uploaded business logos and tier images:
- ✅ Customer Join Page - Shows logo and tier images
- ✅ Customer Welcome - Shows logo and selected tier image
- ✅ Business Success - Shows logo and all tier images

The implementation maintains consistency across all pages while adapting the display style to each page's purpose.
