# API Fix Summary - Business Owner ID Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified
The console showed that the business was being created with a different `owner_id` than the current authenticated user, causing RLS policy violations during image uploads.

## Root Cause
The `/api/create-business.ts` endpoint was creating a NEW user account instead of using the EXISTING authenticated user who made the request.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated API to Use Authenticated User** (`/api/create-business.ts`)
Instead of creating a new user:
```typescript
// OLD - WRONG
const { data: authUser } = await supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.createUser({
  email: businessData.email,
  password: businessData.password,
  // ...
});
```

Now uses the authenticated user from the request:
```typescript
// NEW - CORRECT
const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
const authToken = authHeader.substring(7); // Remove 'Bearer ' prefix
const { data: { user: authUser } } = await supabaseAdmin.auth.getUser(authToken);
```

### 2. **Updated BusinessSetup to Send Auth Token**
The component now sends the auth token with the API request:
```typescript
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();

const response = await apiClient.post('/api/create-business', {
  token,
  sessionId,
  businessData: formData
}, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${session.access_token}`
  }
});
```

### 3. **Removed User Deletion Logic**
Since we're using an existing user, removed all cleanup code that tried to delete the user on failure.

## What This Fixes

1. **Business ownership** - The business is now created with the correct `owner_id` (the authenticated user)
2. **RLS policies pass** - Storage uploads will work because the user owns the business
3. **No duplicate users** - Uses existing authenticated user instead of creating a new one

## Testing

1. The form should now work end-to-end
2. Console should show `ownershipMatch: true`
3. Image uploads should succeed
4. No RLS policy violations

## Important Notes

- The API has been compiled with `npm run build:api`
- The user must be authenticated before calling the API
- The email in the form must match the authenticated user's email
